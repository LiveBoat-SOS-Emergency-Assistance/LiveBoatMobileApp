// Test file to verify audio participants system integration
// This file demonstrates how the audio participants system works in LiveBoat

/*
AUDIO PARTICIPANTS SYSTEM OVERVIEW:

1. **Audio Producer Detection** (consumer.ts):
   - When a new audio producer joins the room, mediaSoup detects it
   - consumer.ts calls `updateAudioParticipant({ remoteProducerId, track })`
   - This adds the participant to the audio participants list

2. **UI Updates** (PreLive.tsx):
   - PreLive component sets up callback with `setAudioParticipantCallback`
   - When audio participants are added/removed/updated, the callback triggers
   - State `audioParticipants` is updated, causing UI to re-render

3. **Audio Management** (utils/liveStream.ts):
   - Manages in-memory store of audio participants
   - Provides functions for add/update/remove operations
   - Handles callback notifications to UI components

4. **UI Display** (PreLive.tsx):
   - Shows horizontal scrollable list of audio participants
   - Each participant shows avatar + audio indicator (muted/unmuted)
   - Uses BlurView for modern glass effect

WORKFLOW:
1. User joins audio conversation
2. mediaSoup detects new audio producer
3. consumer.ts calls updateAudioParticipant()
4. utils/liveStream.ts stores participant and calls UI callback
5. PreLive.tsx updates state and re-renders UI
6. AudioParticipant component displays user with audio indicator

AUDIO PLAYBACK:
- Audio tracks are automatically played through React Native WebRTC
- Each AudioParticipant component manages its own audio track
- No manual audio management needed - tracks play automatically
